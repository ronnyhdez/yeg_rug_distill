	abstract = {Remote sensing is a key method for advancing our understanding of global photosynthesis and is thus critical to understanding terrestrial carbon uptake and climate change. Increasingly sophisticated spectral indices including solar‐induced ﬂorescence (SIF) and the photochemical reﬂectance index (PRI) are considered good proxies of canopy structure, biochemistry, and physiology. However, the relative inﬂuences of illumination intensity and angle on these measures are difﬁcult to unravel, particularly at the scale of whole forest canopies. We exploit the solar dimming during the 2017 North American solar eclipse as well as a clear day before and cloudy day after the day of the eclipse. This novel approach allows us to assess changes in spectral vegetation indices due to illumination intensity independent of changes in illumination angle.},
